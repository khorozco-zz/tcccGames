-- GIT STEPS:
-- make sure you're in the correct directory in your terminal
-- $ git pull, pulls changes made (by other person)
-- $ git status, checks to see what files have changed
-- $ git add FinalProject.hs
-- $ git commit -m "commit description here, what changes were made?"
-- $ git push, pushes changes to git so we both see them
